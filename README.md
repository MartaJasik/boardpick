## Boardpick
Boardpick is a web project I thought of and wrote individually in Spring Boot, for my own use. It is based on BoardGameGeek API and offers the following functionalities:
* individual libraries
* picking a game from own collection based on given criteria
* looking for a new game ideas based on given criteria
* saving scores
* game stats
* leaderboard
* logging in/registering new users
